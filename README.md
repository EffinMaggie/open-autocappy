# Open AutoCappy

## Documentation

This branch will contain automatically generated documentation for the project,
generated by Doxygen from source files.

Ideally we'll get this to build automatically every time the sources are updated
through GitHub Actions and committed to this branch, which should help against
Doxygen's tendency to clobber the whole repository while you're not looking.
